                        <li><mark><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/colombia/crude-oil-production">TradingEconomics.com</a> This website provides historical data/forcasts on numerous different indicators. The economic and business websites/journals are typically
                            good sources of information as the business community requires reliable data to trade and etc. Luckily they include both 'Crude Oil Production' and 'Crude Oil Rigs' as indicators that you can look at. Furthermore you can select the 'Compare' tab on the top of the graphs
                            to pull up 2 countries at a time. Unfortunately the website prompted me to pay for an acount when I tried to look at the data myself, but at the top of the page a link indicates that this data is sourced from the US Energy Information Administration.</mark></li>
                        <li><mark><a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/VEN">The US Energy Information Administration</a> actually has a summary page providing crude oil production graphs for Venezuela. In fact, in Figure 1. the timing of US sanctions imposed on Venezuela are marked on the graph. 
                            However, be aware that the data in the figure seems to be an average over the year, so it is less detailed than in the video. There does appear to be some data you can download but I have yet to check it out further. </mark></li>
                        <li><mark><a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/171.htm">OPEC</a> also has some data on Venezuela oil production in the form of yearly reports that are rather difficult to navigate through and find. I have included the link to the 2019 data 
                            but also reaffirms a note from the video that "Venezuela's oil revenues account for 99 per cent of export earnings."</mark></li>

                <h3>Mike Pompeo Quote:</h3>
                    <p>"The circle is tightening, the humanitarian crisis is increasing by the hour. I talked with our senior person on the ground there in Venezuela last night at 7:00 or 8:00 last night. You can see 
                        the increasing pain and suffering that the Venezuelan people are suffering from."
