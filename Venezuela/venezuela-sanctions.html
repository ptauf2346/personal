                    <h3>2 Types of Economic Warfare</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Capital-sponsored: Capital flight, capital strike, and normal capitalism (competition and the economic war of everyone aginst everyone)</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Against countries that aim to undermine the 'normal' function of capitalism: anti-capitalist, socialist projects</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>State-sponsored: State targeting of another country's economy via sanctions</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only particularly economically powerful states can do this (USA)</li>
                                <li>Targeted against countries that undermine the imperial ambitions of the powerful</li>

                <p><mark>I was unsure about whether or not I could reproduce images from the video directly, so I just recommend you watch <a href="https://youtu.be/mzm2g8ZbORU">it</a>. 
                    It shows up roughly around the 14 min mark.</mark></p>
                <p><mark>There are a few links I found helpful to fact check these graphs as well.</mark></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><mark><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/colombia/crude-oil-production">TradingEconomics.com</a> This website provides historical data/forcasts on numerous different indicators. The economic and business websites/journals are typically
                            good sources of information as the business community requires reliable data to trade and etc. Luckily they include both 'Crude Oil Production' and 'Crude Oil Rigs' as indicators that you can look at. Furthermore you can select the 'Compare' tab on the top of the graphs
                            to pull up 2 countries at a time. Unfortunately the website prompted me to pay for an acount when I tried to look at the data myself, but at the top of the page a link indicates that this data is sourced from the US Energy Information Administration.</mark></li>
                        <li><mark><a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/VEN">The US Energy Information Administration</a> actually has a summary page providing crude oil production graphs for Venezuela. In fact, in Figure 1., the timing US sanctions imposed on Venezuela are marked on the graph. 
                            However, be aware that the data in figure seems to be an average over the year, so it is less detailed than in the video. There does appear to be some data you can download but I have yet to check it out further. </mark></li>
                        <li><mark><a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/171.htm">OPEC</a> also has some data on Venezuela oil production in the form of yearly reports that are rather difficult to navigate through and find. I have included the link to the 2019 data 
                            but also reaffirms a note from the video that "Venezuela's oil revenues account for 99 per cent of export earnings."</mark></li>
