            <p>During my PhD, I have applied to the NSF, Ford Foundation, AHA, NIH F31, and HHMI Gilliam fellowships and have some general advice 
                for anyone else who wishes to apply to these graduate student fellowships.

            <p>I have become fairly interested in education. I think the point of primary/secondary/college education <b>should</b> be to 
            help the individual develop the knowledge, cognitive and interpersonal skills which are required to 1.) foster 
            self esteem/dignity, 2.) enable individuals to navigate a complex society, and 3.) empower individuals to exert self control over their lives.
            I'm particularly interested in critical and analytical thinking skills that have been promoted in graduate school. Unfortunately, in my own experience,
            I wasn't really promoted to develop these skills until graduate schools. As such I'm working to come up with lesson plans that incorporate the types of 
            thinking skills I've been forced to use in my graduate studies but for younger kids. Once I compile a solid 15 scientific activities, I will upload them here 
            and possibly document how well they are received. If there are other online repositories for educational content (I assume there is) then I will also put the 
            items there. The goal for these types of educational plans is to foster curiosity while developing skills for individuals to use when asking questions about 
            the world. One example lesson plan that has inspired this type of work is one I overheard on a youtube video. Essentially students are given a bag of seeds and 
            instructed to work in teams to determine what types of seeds they are. After they successfully determine seed types, they are able to use a microscope and 
            dissect the seeds to see what is inside. Then there is time for reflection on how they went about determining the seed types and how they could improve in subsequent
            mysteries or what they learned while performing this investigation. </p>
