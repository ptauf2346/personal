            <h2>Quotes about education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>“Education can only be stimulated, never produced, by external institutions. The means which are legislatively applied to promote the moral education of citizens are appropriate and useful only to the degree to which they favor the inward development of people’s capacities and inclinations. For all educational development has its sole origin in the inner psychological constitution of human beings, and can only be stimulated, never produced by external institutions” - Wilhelm von Humboldt 1789</li>
                <li>"The most educative influence on human beings is variety of life situations. The true aim of man--not any which is suggested by changing preference but that which is prescribed forever unchangeable reason--is the highest and best proportioned development of all his capacities, in order to form a wholeness of himself. Freedom is its first, indispensable condition. But it demands something more than freedom, something which is connected with freedom, to be sure, and that is : variety of situation. The freest, most independent human being cannot develop properly if he is placed into a monotonous situation." - Wilhelm von Humboldt 1792</li>
                <li>"I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them but to inform their discretion. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power." - Thomas Jefferson - Letter to William Charles Jarvis (28 September 1820)</li>
                <li>“It doesn’t matter what we cover. It matters what you discover.” - Victor F. Weisskopf – MIT Physics Professor</li>
                <li>“What’s important for a person, at any level, is cultivating their own abilities to think for themselves.” - Noam Chomsky interviewed by Arianne Robichaud 2013</li>
            </ul>

Curry 1931</li>
                <p>I found this article to resonate with the current status of secondary education. This article is rather short 
                    and goes on to essentially condemn how college entrance requirements at the time dictate high school 
                    curriculum with deleterious effects. For example, it places restrictions on a student's ability to take 
                    deep dives on particular subject matters that they find intrinsically pulled towards because they must 
                    dedicate time elsewhere to meet college requirements. From brief introspection, I find this to be somewhat 
                    the case these days. I spent a lot of time in high school preparing for college entrance exams or state wide exams
                    and in classes that I didn't really care about (english and some social studies). If you were to play devil's advocate,
                    then you would say that 'kids shouldn't just do what they want because if they did then they would just eat candy all day long etc'. 
                    Which I agree, I think there is a certain level of material that everyone should be exposed to. It is only the exact amount of time 
                    which I had a problem. For example, I took an english class every year in high school. This class met 5 days a week, for approximately
                    1 hour, for the entire school year. My school went from September to June (lets say 8 months of school). That would mean I was in english
                    class for 8 months * 4 weeks/month * 5days/week * 1 hr/day = 160 hours of english per school year. I just wonder how effectively that time 
                    was being used on me. (also this isn't a dis on english, I think its a useful topic but most of it didn't interest me personally. Somebody 
                    could have ~wasted a similar amount of time in physics when they were more personally interested in english.) <br>
                    Furthermore, the subject matter in many of my classes were so broad that it felt like most of the content I learned was surface value memorization
                    of facts and formulas as opposed to learning how these ideas had been generated and how they could be related to things 
                    in the modern world around me. Furthermore, I never even felt as if I questioned anything I was learning in high school. 
                    I just memorized things I was told and completed assignments as instructed. However, maybe I'm just a hater.

                <p>I like this very brief article because of the author's analytical method. Essentially, the author asks the question 
                    'Are our schools teaching our children how to live?'. Then to answer this, the author assesses the activity of the average 
                    10th grade student and tries to see how the actual experience relates to living a 'more wholesome, a richer, and more beneficial life?'.
                    This reminds me of a lesson I learned in graduate school by writing a review article. I learned from my mentor, that when writing a review 
                    you want every sentence in the article to be related to the title. If the sentence you are writing is not addressing the topic in which 
                    you claim to be writing, then it is most likely fluff and to be deleted. It might be a stretch but I think this sort of logic applies to 
                    everything you design. You cannot effectively design and engineer something without a purpose. And I think when you take a look at 
                    educational practices today and ask the same question, 'what is the point of this?', it feels like the current point of educational 
                    practices today are designed to help students check boxes to get into college and then get a job. But I think this is drastically different than what 
                    I think the point of education should be.
